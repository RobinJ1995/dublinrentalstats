# Dublin rental price statistics

Are you looking for a place to live in Dublin? Are you also looking for a depression? Brilliant! This is just the thing you need!

Joking aside, this script, when run, scrapes some basic statistics (currently highest and lowest price for rent/sharing in Dublin county and city centre), outputs them, and keeps a history in the `stats.json` file in case you want to generate statistics based on them.
